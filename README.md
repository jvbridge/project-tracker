# project-tracker
This is a small project tracker app, it was initially made in an hour, however 
it expanded into quite a bit more work.

## Installation

Simply visit https://jvbridge.github.io/project-tracker/
If you wish to host it yourself merely host all the files in the main branch

## Usage

Uses local storage to keep your projects persistant. Every project needs a
name, type, hourly rate of pay, and a due date. Merely enter the information
into the modal that appears after you click "create project" and it will add
a row to the table showing it.
It will also make a button on each row allowing you to delete each project.

If you want to delete all projects put clearProjects() into the console.
